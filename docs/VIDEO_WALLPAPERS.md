# 🎥 Video Wallpapers Guide

Bring your desktop to life with high-performance video wallpapers using `mpvpaper`.

## 🌟 Where to Find Wallpapers
For the best collection of high-quality live wallpapers, I highly recommend:
👉 **[MoeWalls](https://moewalls.com/)**

## 🚀 How to Use
1.  **Download**: Get your favorite `.mp4`, `.webm`, or `.mov` files from MoeWalls.
2.  **Organize**: Place them in your `~/wallpapers/` directory.
3.  **Apply**:
    *   **Manual**: Use the **Wallpaper Picker** (`SUPER + W`) to select a specific video.
    *   **Random**: Use the **Random Video Switcher** (`SUPER + ALT + V`) to cycle through your collection.

## 🛠️ Requirements
This feature is powered by `mpvpaper`, which is automatically installed via the `install.sh` script.

## 💡 Pro Tip
Video wallpapers are optimized for performance, but if you're on a laptop and want to save battery, you can switch back to a static image at any time using the regular Wallpaper Picker.
